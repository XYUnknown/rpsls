# rpsls
An implementation of Rock, Paper, Scissors, Lizard, Spock game

It follows the rules introduced by Sheldon Cooper from The Big Bang Theory:

Scissors cuts Paper

Paper covers Rock

Rock crushes Lizard

Lizard poisons Spock

Spock smashes Scissors

Scissors decapitates Lizard

Lizard eats Paper

Paper disproves Spock

Spock vaporizes Rock

(and as it always has) Rock crushes Scissors
